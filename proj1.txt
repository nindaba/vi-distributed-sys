Please implement the producer-consumer solution using semaphores and a finite
buffer (cf. slides 27-30 of the presentation about advanced synchronization).

You can use arbitrary elements.
Both threads (the producer and the consumer) should print the info about
produced/consumed elements to the standard output.
Use random processing times (simulated by sleeping - Thread.Sleep() in C#, or
time.sleep() in Python).

Admissible languages: C# and Python.

Please work in teams of c.a. three persons.

The results should be **sent via email** to my Vistula account, with the subject ``DCS project 1''.
