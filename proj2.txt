Please implement the following collaborating programs: one generates random
numbers, and it sends them via a socket to the other one.
The second one reads them, and computes their sum.
We do not know in advance the number of elements; the `producer' has to signal
somehow the end of the sequence, e.g., via sending a special message with
`FINISH' instead of the number, or whatever else.

Both: TCP and UDP sockets can be used; the choice is yours.

Admissible languages: C# and Python.

Please work in teams of c.a. three persons (probably the same ones, as for
project I).

The results should be **sent via email** to my Vistula account, with the subject ``DCS project 2''.
